Description: **Note:** *This a fork of the original* ``better_exceptions`` *library.
        This fork is intended to fix some edge cases I reported (see*
        `#47 <https://github.com/Qix-/better-exceptions/issues/47>`__), *but for
        this it adds two dependencies to the project. The fixed errors are too
        small to justify the addition of dependency to the main library, hence
        this fork that I publish for personal use.*

        Usage
        -----
        
        Install ``better_exceptions`` via pip:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            $ pip install better_exceptions
        
        And set the ``BETTER_EXCEPTIONS`` environment variable to any value:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            export BETTER_EXCEPTIONS=1  # Linux / OSX
            setx BETTER_EXCEPTIONS 1    # Windows
        
        That's it!
        
        Python REPL (Interactive Shell)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In order to use ``better_exceptions`` in the Python REPL, first install the
        package (as instructed above) and run:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            $ python -m better_exceptions
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
            (BetterExceptionsConsole)
            >>>
        
        in order to drop into a ``better_exceptions``-enabled Python interactive shell.
        
        Advanced Usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you want to allow the entirety of values to be outputted instead of
        being truncated to a certain amount of characters:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import better_exceptions
            better_exceptions.MAX_LENGTH = None
        
        While using ``better_exceptions`` in production, do not forget to unset
        the ``BETTER_EXCEPTIONS`` variable to avoid leaking sensitive data in
        your logs.
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        If you do not see beautiful exceptions, first make sure that the
        environment variable does exist. You can try ``echo $BETTER_EXCEPTIONS``
        (Linux / OSX) or ``echo %BETTER_EXCEPTIONS%`` (Windows). On Linux and
        OSX, the ``export`` command does not add the variable permanently, you
        will probably need to edit the ``~/.profile`` file to make it
        persistent. On Windows, you need to open a new terminal after the
        ``setx`` command.
        
        Check that there is no conflict with another library, and that the
        ``sys.excepthook`` function has been correctly replaced with the
        ``better_exceptions``'s one. Sometimes other components can set up their
        own exception handlers, such as the ``python3-apport`` Ubuntu package
        that you may need to uninstall.
        
        Make sure that you have not inadvertently deleted the
        ``better_exceptions_hook.pth`` file that should be in the same place as
        the ``better_exceptions`` folder where all of your Python packages are
        installed. Otherwise, try re-installing ``better_exceptions``.
        
        You can also try to manually activate the hook by adding
        ``import better_exceptions; better_exceptions.hook()`` at the beginning
        of your script.
        
        Finally, if you still can not get this module to work, `open a new
        issue <https://github.com/Qix-/better-exceptions/issues/new>`__ by
        describing your problem precisely and detailing your configuration
        (Python and ``better_exceptions`` versions, OS, code snippet,
        interpeter, etc.) so that we can reproduce the bug you are experiencing.
